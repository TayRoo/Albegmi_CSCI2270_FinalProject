# Albegmi_CSCI2270_FinalProject


### Project:
## Created by Bandar Albegmi
My project is going to be about our campus map and is going to
include many known building that a student wants to walk around them
so it is going to be including

 - Norlin
 - Engineering
 - Recreation center
 - UMC
 - Business
 - Fleming
 - Fisk
 - Law
 - Math
 - Humanity

 My project will have most of the methods that we studyed in class like graphing method and Queue Method or even stack
 however all these methods are help my project to get in shape.I will have user act as a buff student where he/she can walk around our beautful campus with having some building in my graph where I wrote in my text file. So some certain buildings to another building and i'm going to use(dijkestra's) the shortest way to certain building to walk to.
simply I will apply these method in my project :
- Add Vertex:
    add edge to map
- Add Edge:
    Add vertex to graph
- Breadth_First_Search:
    searching in map using Breadth_First_Search
- Depth_First_Traversal:
    printing all the vertices Depth_First_Traversal
- Search:
    printing all the adjacent vertices within depth first recursive traversal procedure
- Dijkstra:
    finding the shortest weighted way between two buildings in the map
- Delete Edge:
    deleting an edge between vertices
- Delete Vertex:
    deleting a vertex from the map.
- Display Edges
I Also used Stack for Depth First Traversal and I used Queue for Breadth First Search
I used a struct like vertex which going to incude for example: name of building ,a visited boolen, distance,
vector <adjV> adj is Vector where you can store all adjacent vertices and
a previousV which is a pointer where we can use it in Dijkstra algrathim

I dont think I have probelm running my project unless I used Xcode I have to refrence my text file from option sitting other than that I works great.

Hope You Guys Enjoy my project...
